2006.0,"Scalzi, John",Old Man's War,4.0,,,,,,,,4.0,Hugo Novel Nom(4),3.0,2023-02,"Still not sure if the protagnoist is smug or Scalzi is smug or both. UPDATE: After reading The Forever War, I was like ""Ah, this is what Scalzi was stealing from"" and then Scalzi writes a foreword to TFW explainig how people have accused him of that for a million years but he had not actually read TFW lol. I feel like Haldeman's heteronormativity problem is born of the same fundamental ""whiteness in (american) society is like water to a fish"" problem. Haldeman's weakness feels more honest to me tho"

,"Gaiman, Neil",Sandman,,,,,,,,,,,5.0,2019-10,A sprawling and beautiful work
,"Kirkman, Robert",The Walking Dead,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,2019-10,Most of the good ideas came from here. Black and white with no thought bubbles or narration! A fun ride
,"Jemisin, N. K.",The Broken Kingdoms,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,2021-10,
,"Le Guin, Ursula K.",A Wizard of Earthsea,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,2022-02,A teenager shows off for his friends and a girl and almost destroys the world -- perfect. A master class in worldbuilding through specific yet mundane details; I feel like I've lived with the sailing people of whatever island where Ged meets what'shisname
,"Le Guin, Ursula K.",The Farthest Shore,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,2022-03,See Note for A Wizard of Earthsea
,"Le Guin, Ursula K.",The Tombs of Atuan,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,2022-03,See Note for A Wizard of Earthsea
,"Liu, Cixin",The Dark Forest,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,2022-05,Maybe low key the best of the series (in spite of the usual flaws). Dark Forest principle is one of the stickiest concepts from the novels.
,"Moore, Alan",Watchmen,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,2022-05,Perhaps the best meta-take on superhero comics. Still not sure about how much time we spend inside the comic-in-a-comic with the pirates and the revenge guy and the O'Henry twist.
,"Butler, Octavia","Octavia E. Butler : Kindred, Fledgling, collected stories",,,,,,,,,,,4.0,2022-09,Butler is still the queen. Library had this collection. Turns out it has a joint novelette winner (Bloodchild). Kindred was fine. Fledgling was fine. Speech Sounds was memorable. Also liked the one with the telepathic children and their teacher
,"Kowal, Mary Robinette",The Fated Sky,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,2023-05,"My favorite of the series! Idk, the journey to Mars does it for me. And the hints of Earth-side things we learn more about in the third book. I don't like how the framing removes a lot of potential drama beacuse we know how it will all end."
,"Wells, Martha",Exit Strategy,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,2023-09,"Right back on it, with a little extra helping of an ending suggesting an arc"
,"Le Guin, Ursula K.",Tales from Earthsea,,,,,,,,,,,3.75,2022-07,See Note for A Wizard of Earthsea
,"Wells, Martha",Rogue Protocol,,,,,,,,,,,3.75,2023-08,Tone felt a little overdone at the beginning but it mellowed out and was still fun
,"Lem, Stanislaw",Solaris,,,,,,,,,,,3.5,2022-11,"Turn of the Screw in space? Strange, philosophical work. Kinda sticky, especially the ending and its dealing with meaning and the meaning of meaning"
,"Bester, Alfred",The Stars My Destination,,,,,,,,,,,3.5,2023-04,A pulpy adventure. Surprisingly readable
,"Moore, Alan",Swamp Thing,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,2022-04,"Super weird, but kinda fun. A villain who speaks in iambic pentameter. Surprisingly innovative art design (the hallucination issue)."
,"Lafrenais, Amanda,","FTL, y'all! : tales from the age of the $200 warp drive",,,,,,,,,,,3.0,2022-08,Impulse pick up. Surprisingly fun. The dog story is easily the stickiest
,"Ennis, Garth",Preacher,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,2022-09,"Fun overall. Didn't love the twist with Irish vampire guy at the end. Didn't love the late 90s ""political correctness is bad, we'll offend everyone equally!"" approach."
,"L'Engle, Madeleine",A Wrinkle In Time,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,2023-01,Missed the window probably. Some alarming anti-collectivist stuff that was clearly motivated by Cold War nonsense
,"Brooks, Max",World War Z,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,2023-02,Fun concept. No idea what the movie's deal is lol. Weird hyper-anti-semitism zionism stuff.
,"Couch, Blake",Recursion,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,2023-02,Decent techno-thriller. Critchton-esque.
,"Johnson, Kij",At the mouth of the river of the bees : stories,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,2023-06,"Contains novellal joint winner ""The Man Who Bridged the Mist"". It was fine, cool and atmospheric. I also liked the title story, largely because Montana and vibes. The best story was the one about the trickster dogs tho, at the end! ITAP of the story about adjusting the electrostatic pressure or whatever"
,"Le Guin, Ursula K.",Eye of the Heron,,,,,,,,,,,2.5,2021-09,"Not my favorite, tho anarchism and passive resistance are cool. Still fully realized because Le Guin is the queen"
,"Mignola, Mike",Hellboy,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,2021-11,Started off good with lots of nazi punching. The last 3 volumes didn't do as much for me.
,"Skroce, Steve",Post Americana,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,2022-06,Impulse off-the-shelf pickup. Not very memorable
,"Banks, Iain M.",Consider Phlebas,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,2022-07,"Reddit (and others) love The Culture series. This chronologically first book is not really recommended as an entry point, but I did anyway. Didn't like it at all. The Ringworld section feels a lot like, uh, Ringworld. Pointless shock stuff with the drowning in shit and the cannibal cult. I guess I'll have to try Player of Games or one of the others but this one turned me off the whole franchise. It wasn't even that bad, maybe just overblown expectations?"
,"Kirkman, Robert",Rick Grimes 2000,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,2023-10,"Very silly, didn't go anywhere."
